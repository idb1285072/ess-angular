# Angular

- _Type_: **Front-end framework**
- _Language_: **TypeScript** (superset of JavaScript)
- _Maintained by_: **Google**
- _Purpose_: To build **dynamic, large-scale, single-page web applications**
- Component-based Architecture

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Component-based architecture**
   - Applications are made of **reusable components** (like building blocks).
   - Each component has:
     - **HTML template** (view)
     - **TypeScript class** (logic)
     - **CSS/SCSS** (style)
2. **Two-way data binding**
   - Changes in the UI update the model and vice versa automatically.
3. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
   - Makes it easy to **reuse services** like data fetching across components.
4. **Routing**
   - Allows navigation between pages **without reloading the whole page**.
5. **Reactive programming support**
   - Works with **Observables** (via RxJS) for handling asynchronous data like API calls.
6. **Powerful CLI (Command Line Interface)**
   - Helps **create/scaffold projects, components, services, and modules** quickly.
